## What Is This Sorcery?

Ever wondered what *really* causes aviation incidents? Spoiler: it's rarely just one thing. It's usually a spectacular domino effect of organizational chaos, supervisory slip-ups, human factors, and that one moment where someone thought "eh, what's the worst that could happen?"

**LLM-HFACS** is a data pipeline that takes raw aviation incident reports from NASA's ASRS (Aviation Safety Reporting System) and transforms them into structured insights using the **Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS)** framework — with a little help from our AI friends.

**LLM-HFACS** is a research project that uses Large Language Models to automatically analyze aviation accident reports and classify them according to the **Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS)**. Because reading 215+ accident reports manually is *so* last decade.


## 🎯 What Does This Thing Do?

Imagine you're a safety analyst staring at a mountain of accident reports. Each one needs to be classified across 19 different human factors. Your coffee has gone cold. Your eyes are tired.

**Enter LLM-HFACS!** 🦸

This project takes those accident narratives and feeds them to LLMs that answer the eternal question: *"What went wrong and whose fault was it?"* (okay, we phrase it more scientifically than that)

```
📄 Accident Report  →  🤖 LLM Magic  →  ✅ HFACS Classification
```


## 🧠 The HFACS Framework

HFACS is a fancy taxonomy that breaks down human errors into 4 levels:

| Level                 | What It Means                  | Examples                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **L1: Unsafe Acts**   | The pilot did a whoopsie       | Decision errors, skill-based errors, violations          |
| **L2: Preconditions** | The stage was set for disaster | Fatigue, poor communication, bad weather                 |
| **L3: Supervision**   | The boss dropped the ball      | Inadequate supervision, planned inappropriate operations |
| **L4: Organization**  | The system is broken           | Poor resource management, toxic organizational climate   |

Think of it as a blame pyramid 🔺 — the deeper you go, the more systemic the issue!


## 🤖 Supported Models

We've tested this with:

| Model                  | Where It Runs           | Vibe                                  |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `gpt-4o-mini`          | OpenAI Cloud ☁️          | Fast and cheap, our daily driver      |
| `qwen2.5:32b-instruct` | Ollama (local/remote) 🖥️ | When you want to keep your data close |


## 🎪 Prompting Strategies

We don't just ask the LLM once and call it a day. We've implemented **5 different prompting strategies** to see which one makes the AI think hardest:

| Strategy             | Description                     | Complexity |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **IO**               | Simple yes/no questions         | ⭐          |
| **IO Expanded**      | Detailed questions with context | ⭐⭐         |
| **IO Merged**        | All factors in one mega-prompt  | ⭐⭐         |
| **Chain-of-Thought** | "Think step by step..."         | ⭐⭐⭐        |
| **Tree-of-Thought**  | Hierarchical reasoning          | ⭐⭐⭐⭐       |

## 📈 Metrics We Track

| Metric        | Question It Answers                            |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Precision** | When the AI says "YES", is it right?           |
| **Recall**    | Does the AI find all the factors humans found? |
| **F1 Score**  | The harmonious balance of both                 |
